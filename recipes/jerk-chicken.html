        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Jerk Chicken is a quintessential Jamaican dish renowned for its bold and spicy flavors. Marinated in a fiery blend of allspice, Scotch bonnet peppers, thyme, garlic, and other seasonings, the chicken is traditionally grilled over pimento wood, giving it a distinctive smoky aroma. The result is a deliciously charred and succulent chicken with a perfect balance of heat and sweetness. Jerk Chicken is often served with rice and peas, festival, or a fresh green salad, making it a staple of Caribbean cuisine that brings a taste of the tropics to any table.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 Scotch bonnet peppers</li>
            <li>1 bunch scallions, roughly chopped, plus more sliced for serving</li>
            <li>12 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1 (2") piece ginger, peeled</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of dark brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of pineapple juice (optional)</li>
            <li>2 limes</li>
            <li>12 sprigs thyme</li>
            <li>12 allspice berries</li>
            <li>2 tsp of ground allspice</li>
            <li>3 bay leaves</li>
            <li>2 tsp of ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp of kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp of black peppercorns</li>
            <li>1 tsp of ground cloves</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of reduced-sodium soy sauce, plus 2 tbsp for sauce (optional)</li>
            <li>4 lb. boneless or bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts and/or thighs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup ketchup</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a blender, mix Scotch bonnet peppers, scallions, garlic, ginger, brown sugar, pineapple juice (if using), lime juice, thyme, allspice, bay leaves, nutmeg, salt, peppercorns, cloves, and 1/4 cup soy sauce until smooth. Reserve 1/2 cup marinade; refrigerate until ready to serve. Transfer remaining marinade to a large bowl. Add chicken; toss to coat, making sure to rub marinade under skin. Cover and refrigerate at least overnight or up to 12 hours.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, stir ketchup and remaining 2 tablespoons soy sauce (if using).</li>
            <li>Prepare a grill for high heat; heat 5 minutes. Using tongs and a paper towel, dip paper towel into oil and lightly brush grates. After 30 seconds, brush with oil again.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to low and grill chicken skin side down, covered, until golden brown and lightly charred, 10 to 12 minutes. Flip chicken, cover, and continue to grill until lightly charred, about 3 minutes more. Flip chicken skin side up and brush with ketchup-soy basting sauce (if using). Cover and continue to grill until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of chicken registers 165Â°, about 3 minutes more (white meat and boneless meat will cook at a faster rate).</li>
            <li>Transfer chicken to a platter. Top with scallions. Serve with reserved marinade and lime wedges alongside. </li>
        </ol>
